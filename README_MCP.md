# Little Alchemy 2 Text - MCP Integration

This project now supports playing Little Alchemy 2 Text via the Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing LLM clients to play the game directly.

## What's New

The game can now be played through MCP tools, making it accessible to any MCP-compatible LLM client like Claude Desktop, ChatGPT with MCP support, or custom implementations.

### Enhanced Game Engine

This version includes major improvements to the original game engine:

- **üéØ Multi-result combinations** - Fixed a fundamental limitation where combinations like `pressure + lava` now correctly produce **both** `granite` and `eruption` simultaneously
- **üîí Final items support** - The game automatically detects and notifies you when you discover final items that cannot be combined further
- **üìä Enhanced feedback** - Improved combination result detection and reporting through the MCP interface

## Setup

### Prerequisites

1. **Install dependencies** (choose one method):

   **Option A: Using conda (recommended for full compatibility)**

   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   conda activate little_alchemy_2_text
   ```

   **Option B: Using pip**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Install MCP dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install mcp
   ```

### Running the MCP Server

1. **Start the MCP server**:

   ```bash
   python mcp_server.py
   ```

2. **Configure your MCP client** to connect to this server using the configuration in `mcp_config.json`.

## How to Play via MCP

1. **Start a game**:

   ```json
   {
     "tool": "start_game",
     "arguments": {
       "session_id": "my-game-1",
       "game_mode": "open-ended",
       "max_rounds": 15
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Check your status**:

   ```json
   {
     "tool": "get_game_state",
     "arguments": {
       "session_id": "my-game-1"
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Make combinations** (now with reasoning logging):

   ```json
   {
     "tool": "make_move",
     "arguments": {
       "session_id": "my-game-1",
       "item1": "air",
       "item2": "fire",
       "reasoning_explanation": "Air and fire should create energy through combustion"
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Experience multi-result combinations**:

   ```json
   {
     "tool": "make_move",
     "arguments": {
       "session_id": "my-game-1",
       "item1": "pressure",
       "item2": "lava"
     }
   }
   ```

   **Response:**

   ```text
   ‚úÖ SUCCESS! 'pressure' + 'lava' = 'eruption', 'granite'
   üéâ 2 items have been added to your inventory: 'eruption', 'granite'
   üîí 'eruption' is a final item and cannot be combined with other items.
   üîí 'granite' is a final item and cannot be combined with other items.
   ```

## Comprehensive Attempt Logging

### Overview

Every attempt (successful or failed) is automatically logged with comprehensive parameters for detailed analysis. This is ideal for research, learning pattern analysis, and understanding player behavior.

### Logged Parameters

Each attempt captures the following 12 parameters:

| Parameter                 | Description                            | Example                                |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `Session_ID`              | Unique game session identifier         | `"my-game-1"`                          |
| `Attempt_Number`          | Sequential attempt number (1, 2, 3...) | `5`                                    |
| `Element_1`               | First element in combination           | `"fire"`                               |

| `Success`                 | Whether the combination succeeded      | `true`                                 |
| `Result_Element`          | Created element(s) if successful       | `"steam"` or `"granite, eruption"`     |
| `Inventory_Size_Before`   | Number of items before this attempt    | `8`                                    |
| `Reasoning_Explanation`   | Player's reasoning for the attempt     | `"Fire and water should create steam"` |
| `Is_Novel_Combination`    | First time trying this combination     | `true`                                 |
| `Current_Streak_Type`     | Current streak type                    | `"success"` or `"failure"`             |
| `Current_Streak_Length`   | Length of current streak               | `3`                                    |
| `Time_Since_Last_Success` | Seconds since last successful attempt  | `45.2` or `null`                       |

‚ùå #7: energy + earth | Reasoning: Trying to create earthquake
‚úÖ #8: fire + water -> steam | Reasoning: Evaporation process
```

#### 2. Export Complete Data (JSON)

```json
{
  "tool": "get_attempt_logs",
  "arguments": {
    "session_id": "my-game-1",
    "format": "json"
  }
}
```

    "format": "csv"
  }
}
```

### Debug & Monitoring

Check the logging system status across all sessions:

```json
{
  "tool": "debug_logging_status",
  "arguments": {}
}
```

**Response:**

```text
üîç LOGGING SYSTEM DEBUG STATUS

Total sessions with logs: 2

üìä LOG SUMMARY BY SESSION:
  ‚Ä¢ Session 'my-game-1': 8 attempts
    Last attempt: fire + water = ‚úÖ
    Last logged: 2024-01-15T14:30:25.123456
  ‚Ä¢ Session 'test-session': 3 attempts
    Last attempt: air + earth = ‚ùå
    Last logged: 2024-01-15T14:25:10.987654

üí° TO ACCESS LOGS:
Use 'get_attempt_logs' with your session_id to view detailed logs.
```

### Automatic Feedback

Every `make_move` response now includes logging confirmation:

```text
‚úÖ SUCCESS! 'fire' + 'water' = 'steam'
üéâ 'steam' has been added to your inventory!

Rounds used: 5/15
Items discovered: 9
üìù Logged attempt #5 (Use 'get_attempt_logs' to view all logs)
```

### Use Cases

1. **Research Analysis**: Export CSV data for statistical analysis of learning patterns
2. **Player Behavior Study**: Analyze reasoning explanations and decision patterns
3. **Success Pattern Recognition**: Identify which reasoning approaches lead to success
4. **Streak Analysis**: Study how success/failure streaks affect player behavior
5. **Timing Analysis**: Understand how time pressure affects decision making
6. **Novel vs. Repeated Attempts**: Compare performance on new vs. familiar combinations

## Game Modes

- **Open-ended**: Discover as many items as possible with no specific target
- **Targeted**: Find a specific target item (more challenging)

## Example MCP Client Configuration

For Claude Desktop, add to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "little-alchemy-2-text": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["path/to/your/mcp_server.py"],
      "cwd": "path/to/your/LittleAlchemy2Text_MCP",
      "env": {
        "PYTHONPATH": "."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Tips for Playing

1. Start with basic elements: air, earth, fire, water
2. Try logical combinations first (fire + water = steam)
3. Build on your discoveries (steam + air = cloud)
4. Look for **multi-result combinations** - some create multiple items at once!
5. Pay attention to final item notifications - they help you focus on combinable items
6. **Add reasoning explanations** to your attempts for better logging and analysis
7. Use `get_attempt_logs` to review your strategy and success patterns
8. Pay attention to successful combinations from other sessions
9. Experiment! There are hundreds of possible combinations
