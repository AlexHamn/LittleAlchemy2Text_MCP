# Little Alchemy 2 Text - MCP Integration

This project now supports playing Little Alchemy 2 Text via the Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing LLM clients to play the game directly.

## What's New

The game can now be played through MCP tools, making it accessible to any MCP-compatible LLM client like Claude Desktop, ChatGPT with MCP support, or custom implementations.

### Enhanced Game Engine

This version includes major improvements to the original game engine:

- **üéØ Multi-result combinations** - Fixed a fundamental limitation where combinations like `pressure + lava` now correctly produce **both** `granite` and `eruption` simultaneously
- **üîí Final items support** - The game automatically detects and notifies you when you discover final items that cannot be combined further
- **üìä Enhanced feedback** - Improved combination result detection and reporting through the MCP interface

## Setup

### Prerequisites

1. **Install dependencies** (choose one method):

   **Option A: Using conda (recommended for full compatibility)**

   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   conda activate little_alchemy_2_text
   ```

   **Option B: Using pip**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Install MCP dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install mcp
   ```

### Running the MCP Server

1. **Start the MCP server**:

   ```bash
   python mcp_server.py
   ```

2. **Configure your MCP client** to connect to this server using the configuration in `mcp_config.json`.

   {
     "tool": "start_game",
     "arguments": {
       "session_id": "123456",
       "game_mode": "open-ended",
       "max_rounds": 15,
       "reasoning_type": "logical"
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Check your status**:

   ```json
   {
     "tool": "get_game_state",
     "arguments": {
       "session_id": "my-game-1"
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Make combinations** (now with reasoning logging):

   ```json
   {
     "tool": "make_move",
     "arguments": {
       "session_id": "123456",
       "item1": "air",
       "item2": "fire",
       "reasoning_explanation": "Air and fire should create energy through combustion"
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Experience multi-result combinations**:

   ```json
   {
     "tool": "make_move",
     "arguments": {

   ```

   **Response:**

   ```text
   ‚úÖ SUCCESS! 'pressure' + 'lava' = 'eruption', 'granite'
   üéâ 2 items have been added to your inventory: 'eruption', 'granite'
   üîí 'eruption' is a final item and cannot be combined with other items.
   üîí 'granite' is a final item and cannot be combined with other items.
   ```

## Comprehensive Attempt Logging

### Overview

Every attempt (successful or failed) is automatically logged with comprehensive parameters for detailed analysis. This is ideal for research, learning pattern analysis, and understanding player behavior.

### Logged Parameters

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: All parameter keys are shortened to minimize character usage in logs due to size constraints.

Each attempt captures the following 12 parameters:

| Parameter | Description                            | Example                                |

| `ok`      | Whether the combination succeeded      | `true`                                 |
| `res`     | Created element(s) if successful       | `"steam"` or `"granite, eruption"`     |
| `inv_b4`  | Number of items before this attempt    | `8`                                    |
| `reason`  | Player's reasoning for the attempt     | `"Fire and water should create steam"` |
| `novel`   | First time trying this combination     | `true`                                 |
| `str_typ` | Current streak type                    | `"success"` or `"failure"`             |

### Reasoning Type Categories

The system supports multiple reasoning type classifications for comparative analysis:

- **`logical`** - Science-based, cause-and-effect reasoning
- **`creative`** - Imaginative, associative thinking
- **`systematic`** - Methodical, organized exploration
- **`random`** - Experimental, trial-and-error approach
- **`heuristic`** - Pattern-based, experience-driven decisions
- **`collaborative`** - Group-based or discussion-informed choices
- **`intuitive`** - Gut-feeling or instinct-based attempts

### Research Applications

#### Educational Research

- Compare learning effectiveness across different reasoning approaches
- Analyze correlation between reasoning type and success rates
- Study plateau patterns and breakthrough moments

#### AI Behavior Analysis

- Evaluate different AI reasoning strategies
- Compare human vs. AI learning patterns
- Assess reasoning consistency across sessions

#### Cognitive Science

- Analyze problem-solving strategy evolution
- Study decision-making patterns under different conditions
- Evaluate cognitive load and performance correlation

#### Game Design Optimization

- Identify optimal difficulty progression
- Analyze player engagement patterns
- Optimize feedback and hint systems

### Multi-Session Analysis

Export data from multiple sessions to compare:

```json
{
  "tool": "get_session_logs",
  "arguments": {
    "format": "csv"
  }
}
```

This exports all session data for statistical analysis in tools like:

- **Excel/Google Sheets** - Basic statistical analysis and visualization
- **R/Python** - Advanced statistical modeling and machine learning
- **SPSS/SAS** - Professional statistical analysis
- **Tableau/Power BI** - Interactive data visualization and dashboards

## Game Modes

- **Open-ended**: Discover as many items as possible with no specific target
- **Targeted**: Find a specific target item (more challenging)

## Example MCP Client Configuration

For Claude Desktop, add to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "little-alchemy-2-text": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["path/to/your/mcp_server.py"],
      "cwd": "path/to/your/LittleAlchemy2Text_MCP",
      "env": {
        "PYTHONPATH": "."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Tips for Playing

1. Start with basic elements: air, earth, fire, water
2. Try logical combinations first (fire + water = steam)
3. Build on your discoveries (steam + air = cloud)
4. Look for **multi-result combinations** - some create multiple items at once!
5. Pay attention to final item notifications - they help you focus on combinable items
6. **Specify reasoning types** when starting games to enable cognitive approach analysis
7. **Include reasoning explanations** with every attempt (required for logging and analysis)
8. Use `get_attempt_logs` to review individual attempt patterns and strategies
9. Use `get_session_logs` to analyze overall performance and learning effectiveness
10. Pay attention to successful combinations from other sessions
11. Experiment! There are hundreds of possible combinations
