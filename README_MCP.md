# Little Alchemy 2 Text - MCP Integration

This project now supports playing Little Alchemy 2 Text via the Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing LLM clients to play the game directly.

## What's New

The game can now be played through MCP tools, making it accessible to any MCP-compatible LLM client like Claude Desktop, ChatGPT with MCP support, or custom implementations.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

1. **Install dependencies** (choose one method):

   **Option A: Using conda (recommended for full compatibility)**

   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   conda activate little_alchemy_2_text
   ```

   **Option B: Using pip**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Install MCP dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install mcp
   ```

### Running the MCP Server

1. **Start the MCP server**:

   ```bash
   python mcp_server.py
   ```

2. **Configure your MCP client** to connect to this server using the configuration in `mcp_config.json`.

## MCP Tools Available

### Game Management

- **`start_game`** - Start a new game session
- **`get_game_state`** - View current inventory and game status
- **`make_move`** - Combine two items to create new ones
- **`list_active_sessions`** - See all active game sessions
- **`end_game`** - End a game session and get final summary

### Resources

- **Game Rules** (`game://rules`) - How to play instructions
- **Combinations Guide** (`game://combinations`) - Common item combinations

## How to Play via MCP

1. **Start a game**:

   ```json
   {
     "tool": "start_game",
     "arguments": {
       "session_id": "my-game-1",
       "game_mode": "open-ended",
       "max_rounds": 15
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Check your status**:

   ```json
   {
     "tool": "get_game_state",
     "arguments": {
       "session_id": "my-game-1"
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Make combinations**:

   ```json
   {
     "tool": "make_move",
     "arguments": {
       "session_id": "my-game-1",
       "item1": "air",
       "item2": "fire"
     }
   }
   ```

## Game Modes

- **Open-ended**: Discover as many items as possible with no specific target
- **Targeted**: Find a specific target item (more challenging)

## Example MCP Client Configuration

For Claude Desktop, add to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "little-alchemy-2-text": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["path/to/your/mcp_server.py"],
      "cwd": "path/to/your/LittleAlchemy2Text_MCP",
      "env": {
        "PYTHONPATH": "."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Tips for Playing

1. Start with basic elements: air, earth, fire, water
2. Try logical combinations first (fire + water = steam)
3. Build on your discoveries (steam + air = cloud)
4. Pay attention to successful combinations from other sessions
5. Experiment! There are hundreds of possible combinations

## Game Features via MCP

- âœ… Full game functionality through MCP tools
- âœ… Multiple concurrent game sessions
- âœ… Real-time inventory and combination tracking

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed correctly
2. Check that the MCP server starts without errors
3. Verify your MCP client configuration
4. Check the game paths in your environment
