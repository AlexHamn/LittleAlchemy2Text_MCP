# Little Alchemy 2 Text MCP

A text-based version of the game Little Alchemy 2 that can be played by humans via command line interface or by AI agents through **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**.

## Overview

This project builds upon [LittleAlchemy2Text](https://github.com/eleninisioti/LittleAlchemy2Text) by adding comprehensive **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** support for AI/LLM integration.

LittleAlchemy2Text itself extended [Wordcraft](https://github.com/minqi/wordcraft), a Python-based implementation of Little Alchemy 2.

**This MCP version adds:**

- **🤖 Model Context Protocol (MCP) support** - Full integration for AI/LLM clients using structured tools
- **🔧 Professional API design** - Clean, standardized interface following MCP specifications
- **📱 Multi-session management** - Handle multiple concurrent games with unique session IDs
- **📊 Enhanced feedback** - Rich game state reporting and real-time combination results
- **🎯 Multi-result combinations** - Fixed game engine to support combinations that produce multiple items simultaneously
- **🔒 Final items detection** - Automatic identification and notification of final items that cannot be combined further

## Game Modes

### Open-Ended Mode

Start with the four basic elements (`air`, `earth`, `fire`, `water`) and discover as many items as possible by combining elements. Perfect for exploration and creativity.

### Targeted Mode

Find specific target items within a limited number of rounds. Includes distractors and depth settings for varying difficulty levels.

## Enhanced Game Engine

### Multi-Result Combinations

This version includes a **major improvement** to the original game engine that fixes a fundamental limitation. Some combinations in Little Alchemy 2 should produce multiple items simultaneously, but the original engine could only create one item per combination.

**Fixed Examples:**

- `pressure + lava` → **both** `granite` and `eruption` ✅
- Previously would only create one of these items ❌

**Technical Details:**

- Modified recipe book to support multiple entities per recipe
- Updated environment step function to handle multiple new items
- Enhanced MCP server to detect and report all created items

### Final Items Support

The game now recognizes **final items** - items that cannot be combined with other elements to create new items. When you discover a final item, you'll receive a notification:

🔒 _'granite' is a final item and cannot be combined with other items._

This helps players understand which items they can continue experimenting with and which represent endpoints in the combination tree. There are **170 final items** out of 700 total items in the game.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+** (tested with Python 3.11)
- **Operating System**: Linux or macOS

### Option 1: Conda Environment (Recommended)

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate little_alchemy_2_text
```

### Option 2: Pip Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For MCP functionality, also install:

```bash
pip install mcp
```

## How to Play

### 🖥️ Command Line Interface

Play with human players through an interactive terminal interface:

```bash
python play.py
```

You'll be prompted to specify:

- Number of human players
- Game mode (targeted or open-ended)
- Number of rounds
- Other game settings

### 🤖 MCP (Model Context Protocol) Interface

**Full AI/LLM integration** - Any MCP-compatible client can play the game using natural language!

#### Start the MCP Server

```bash
python mcp_server.py
```

#### Available MCP Tools

- **`start_game`** - Create new game sessions with custom settings
- **`get_game_state`** - View inventory, combinations, and progress
- **`make_move`** - Combine two items to discover new ones
- **`list_active_sessions`** - Manage multiple concurrent games
- **`end_game`** - Complete sessions with detailed summaries

#### Example MCP Gameplay

```
🎮 "Start a new Little Alchemy game"
→ Creates session with air, earth, fire, water

🔬 "Combine air and fire"
→ ✅ SUCCESS! air + fire = energy

🎯 "What's in my inventory?"
→ Current items: air, earth, fire, water, energy
```

#### MCP Client Configuration

For Claude Desktop, add to your configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "little-alchemy-2-text": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["mcp_server.py"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/LittleAlchemy2Text_MCP"
    }
  }
}
```

## Key Features

### ✅ Complete MCP Integration

- **Multiple concurrent sessions** with unique IDs
- **Real-time game state** tracking and updates
- **Comprehensive error handling** with clear feedback
- **Built-in help resources** (rules, common combinations)
- **Session management** (start, pause, resume, end)

### 🎮 Enhanced Gameplay

- **Multi-result combinations** - Combinations now correctly produce all intended items (e.g., pressure + lava → granite + eruption)
- **Final items detection** - Automatic identification of items that cannot be combined further
- **Rich combination feedback** - Success/failure with explanations and multi-item notifications
