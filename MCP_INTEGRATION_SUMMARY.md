## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Option A: Full environment (recommended)
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate little_alchemy_2_text

# Option B: Minimal MCP setup
pip install mcp gymnasium numpy python-box
```

### 2. Run the MCP Server

```bash
python mcp_server.py
```

### 3. Configure Your MCP Client

Add to your MCP client configuration (e.g., Claude Desktop):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "little-alchemy-2-text": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["mcp_server.py"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/LittleAlchemy2Text_MCP",
      "env": {
        "PYTHONPATH": "."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 4. Start Playing!

Use natural language with your LLM client:

- "Start a new Little Alchemy game"
- "Show me my current inventory"
- "Combine air and fire"
- "What's my game status?"

## 🎯 Example MCP Gameplay

```
LLM: I want to play Little Alchemy 2!

Tool: start_game("my-session", "open-ended", 15)
→ ✅ Game started with air, earth, fire, water

LLM: Let me try combining air and fire

Tool: make_move("my-session", "air", "fire")
→ ✅ SUCCESS! air + fire = energy

LLM: What else can I make with energy?

Tool: get_game_state("my-session")
→ Current inventory: air, earth, fire, water, energy
→ 14 rounds remaining

LLM: Let me try energy and earth

Tool: make_move("my-session", "energy", "earth")
→ ✅ SUCCESS! energy + earth = earthquake
```

## ✨ Key Features

- **🔄 Multiple Sessions** - Run several games simultaneously
- **📊 Real-time Feedback** - Immediate success/failure responses
- **🏆 Progress Tracking** - Rounds used, items discovered, combinations tried
